# chgcap - Change-Data-Capture Connectors Library

chgcap is an open-source library for Change-Data-Capture (CDC). Written in Rust, it is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Debezium, providing an alternative to the Java-based ecosystem and allowing for native CDC without relying on third parties such as Kafka Connect. We initially focus on the Rust API, but will consider other language bindings if there are many requests for them.

## Features

It aims to provide all main features supported by Debezium, including:

- Ensures that **all data changes** are captured.
- Produces change events with a **very low delay** while avoiding increased CPU usage required for frequent polling. For example, for MySQL or PostgreSQL, the delay is in the millisecond range.
- Requires **no changes to your data model**, such as a "Last Updated" column.
- Can **capture deletes**.
- Can **capture old record state and additional metadata** such as transaction ID and causing query, depending on the databaseâ€™s capabilities and configuration.
- Support for loading the **initial snapshot** before consuming the incremental data.

### Supported Databases

| Connector    | Database | Driver                                                         |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| chgcap-mysql | MySQL    | [mysql_async](https://docs.rs/mysql_async/latest/mysql_async/) |

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install chgcap, use `cargo`:

`$ cargo install chgcap`

### Usage

To use chgcap, you must first configure a connector for the source database. Once the configuration is complete, you can start streaming the data using the API.
